Rabbit Manager

A system through which The Corporation will be managed and run. The design will specifically employ a 
modular system so modules can be added and removed without affecting other portions. As a result, 
interop between the sections is not permitted, unless via "extensions". These extensions will be 
declared as extensions, and treated as interop only. They will check if they should be loaded, and if
if it is not appropriate to load the extension, it will cancel loading, and let the rest of the 
section carry on.
